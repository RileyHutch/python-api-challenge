# python-api-challenge

WeatherPy:
Openweather website info
had chatgpt explain the open_weather_dataframe_solution version of this and it gave a simpler version
open_weather_dataframe_solution version
JSON format API response fields from OpenWeather and  open_weather_dataframe_solution
weather_stats_solution but I don't like it or quite understand it so I used GPT to create a different way
        solution: fit_line = slope * x_data + intercept and it kept erroring since it was seperate so GPT came up with this as a solution
banking_deserts_solution used         


VacationPy:
geoviews_demo_solution used
restaurants_solution used
used chatgpt to help structure funtion for filtered_cities_df
